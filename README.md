# Security Verification Test Suite for UTM Stack

## Goal
This project aims to implement a security verification test suite for the Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM) services.

## Scope
This project encompasses two primary phases. Initially, it involves the implementation verification of UTM adapter specifications.
This phase ensures that the UTM adapter adheres to the specified requirements and functions as intended.
Subsequently, the project focuses on verifying the security features associated with individual UTM services.
This comprehensive approach aims to assess the robustness and effectiveness of cybersecurity measures implemented within the UTM ecosystem.

## Deliverables

1. Test framework for UTM adapter functional specifications
2. Secutity test frameowrk for UTM services.
   * Develop test cases to verify each security feature, ensuring that they meet the specified requirements
   * Document the results of the security verification process, including any findings, recommendations, and
     corrective actions taken.
